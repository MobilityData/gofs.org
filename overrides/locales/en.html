    "section4block3": '<span class="highlighted-text">What’s the level of effort to implement GOFS?</span></br>Generally medium-to-low effort: existing technology systems usually already have the required data. Effort should be focused around understanding the GOFS standard and accurately transforming existing service data into GOFS.',

It is challenging for travellers to get an overview of their options. Standardization allows common journey planning apps to easily integrate a multitude of transportation providers.
